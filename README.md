"# useful-functions"

I've pulled these functions from many locations, over the years. Unfortunately, lots of the 
documentation has been lost, and attribution is lacking.

List of contributions:
	- Lynda.com playlists
	- Various developers, and forum posts
	- Do you recognize any of the functions contained within? Please let me know, and I'll update
		the attribution, in a comment next to the code. Thanks!
